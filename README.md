# Converting Casual Riders to Annual Members

**Introduction**

Welcome to Cyclistic's bike-share analysis case study! Cyclistic is a popular bike-share program based in Chicago, known for its diverse fleet and numerous docking stations. As part of the marketing analytics team, our goal is to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently.

Our aim is to uncover insights that will help drive strategic marketing initiatives, with a focus on increasing annual memberships and ensuring sustainable growth for Cyclistic. Come along as we explore the data and discover actionable recommendations to shape the future of bike-sharing in Chicago.

## 1. Total Rides:

"Rides Distribution"
In our analysis of two years worth of data, we found that casual riders constitute 42% of all Cyclistic riders. Our primary objective is to identify factors that can reduce this percentage by converting casual riders into annual members.

## 2. Monthly Ride Trends by Bike Type:

### Seasonal Trends:

1. Casual ridership experiences a significant decrease during the winter months (December to February), while member ridership remains relatively steady, indicating potential seasonality effects on bike usage.
2. Both member and casual ridership show an overall increase from May to September, indicating a peak season for bike usage. However, while member ridership remains relatively stable during these months, casual ridership varies more, influenced by seasonal factors and people's preferences for biking in pleasant weather.

### Bike Preference Variability:

 1. Preferred bike types among members vary over time, with different bikes leading in usage at different times. In contrast, casual riders consistently prefer docked bikes during the 
summer months, indicating a preference for traditional bike options, especially during peak recreational periods where outdoor activities are preferred.

## 3. Weekly Ride Trends :

### Weekday Ridership Patterns:

Casual ridership peaks during weekends, with a significant increase compared to weekdays. This suggests that weekends attract more recreational or leisurely biking activities among casual riders. 
In contrast, member ridership remains relatively stable throughout the week, with no significant fluctuations observed between weekdays and weekends. Members may use Cyclistic bikes more consistently for commuting or regular transportation purposes, regardless of the day of the week.

## 4. Hourly Ride Patterns and Avg Durations:

  ![avg ride duration](https://github.com/mashoodsyed66/Cyclist-Case-Study/assets/65015378/550a3eb4-d568-46ca-b9cb-bdf5ab09e1d6)

1. The hourly ridership data indicates that member ridership peaks during typical office or school hours, particularly at 8 AM and 5 PM. This aligns with our earlier observation from the weekday analysis, where we noticed consistent member ridership throughout the week, suggesting potential commuting patterns.

2. Additionally, the average ride duration for members is significantly shorter compared to casual riders. This further supports the notion that members may be using the bikes for shorter, utilitarian trips, such as commuting to work or school, as they prefer to spend less time on each ride.

3. In contrast, casual ridership peaks later in the morning and early afternoon, indicating that casual riders tend to use the bikes during their leisure time or for recreational purposes. This observation reinforces our earlier findings from the weekday analysis, where we noted higher casual ridership on weekends, suggesting more leisurely or recreational usage during those times.

4. The longer average duration of casual rides may indicate that they use the bikes for exercise and fun activities, especially during the summer months and on weekends when they are more active.

# Summary of Analysis: 

1. Casual riders constitute a significant portion (42%) of all riders, indicating an opportunity to convert them into annual members.

2. Seasonal trends show a decrease in casual ridership during winter months, while both member and casual ridership increase from May to September, with casual ridership showing more variability.

3. Bike preference varies over time, with members showing a preference for different bikes compared to casual riders, who consistently prefer docked bikes during summer months.

4. Weekly ridership patterns indicate that casual ridership peaks during weekends, suggesting recreational or leisurely usage, while member ridership remains stable throughout the week, potentially for commuting purposes.

5. Hourly ride patterns reveal peak member ridership during typical office or school hours, with shorter ride durations compared to casual riders, who tend to have longer rides, particularly during leisure hours.

# Recommendation based on analysis:
1. Offer special deals in summer and weekends to make annual passes more attractive.
2. Give discounts for weekend rides to show the benefits of yearly memberships.
3. Explain how getting a yearly pass saves money and is convenient for regular riders.
