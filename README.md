# Cyclist-Case-Study

**Introduction**

Welcome to Cyclistic's bike-share analysis case study! Cyclistic is a popular bike-share program based in Chicago, known for its diverse fleet and numerous docking stations. As part of the marketing analytics team, our goal is to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently.

Our aim is to uncover insights that will help drive strategic marketing initiatives, with a focus on increasing annual memberships and ensuring sustainable growth for Cyclistic. Come along as we explore the data and discover actionable recommendations to shape the future of bike-sharing in Chicago.

"Rides Distribution"
In our analysis of two years worth of data, we found that casual riders constitute 42% of all Cyclistic riders. Our primary objective is to identify factors that can reduce this percentage by converting casual riders into annual members.
