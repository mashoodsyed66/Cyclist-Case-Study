"Rides Distribution"
In our analysis of two years worth of data, we found that casual riders constitute 42% of all Cyclistic riders. Our primary objective is to identify factors that can reduce this percentage by converting casual riders into annual members.

Casual ridership experiences a significant decrease during the winter months (December to February), while member ridership remains relatively steady, indicating potential seasonality effects on bike usage.
Casual ridership peaks from May to September, corresponding to the summer season, suggesting increased recreational activities during warmer weather. Both member and casual ridership show a consistent increase from May to October, indicating a peak season for bike usage.
Bike Preference Variability:

Preferred bike types among members vary over time, with different bikes leading in usage at different times. In contrast, casual riders consistently prefer docked bikes during the summer months, indicating a preference for traditional bike options, especially during peak recreational periods.
